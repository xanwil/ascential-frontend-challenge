# The Ascential Frontend Challenge

Welcome to the frontend challenge at Ascential, where creativity meets technology. We're passionate about innovation and delivering exceptional digital experiences. Below are some tasks which might give you an idea of the sort of challenges we encounter. 

## Task 1: Debugging Precision

The team discovered that the event datetime on the event details page (e.g. /events/6250467) is displayed in the timezone of the app's user. However, the intent was to show it in the local timezone of the event location instead (still displaying the timezone name or offset). After a discussion the team decided to make the change, but keep the time in the user's timezone as a tooltip when hovering the timestamp. You pick up that ticket.

**Guidelines for Task 1:**
- Treat this as if you fixed a bug in an app you work on together with a team, and the app is in production

## Task 2: Innovating Efficiency
We envision enhancing our app with a "favorites" feature to streamline user engagement. Your task is to design and implement this feature with a focus on simplicity and efficiency.

**Requirements:**
- Users can mark events or venues as favorites from both the list and details pages.
- A slide-in drawer displays the list of favorite items for easy access.
- Users can navigate to favorite items directly from the list.
- Seamless removal of items from the favorites list is possible within the list and on the details page.
- Persistence of the favorites list even after the app is closed (but everything is stored locally for now).

**Guidelines for Task 2:**
- treat this as if you implemented a new feature in an app you work on together with a team, and the app is in production
- this app is not finished, there will be more pages added in the future, and the feature you're implementing might be extended - consider that when building your solution
- most UI components should be available in Chakra UI
- when in doubt about the design or functionality, make a decision yourself
- we estimate that this task can be done within a few hours - you can use the PR description to list and discuss the things you decided to de-scope, potential next steps etc.

## Task 3: Elevating Experience
This task invites you to showcase your creativity and skills by adding an impressive feature or enhancement to the app. Whether it's refining the UI, exploring untapped API potentials like adding search and filters or introducing captivating animations, the choice is yours.

**Guidelines for Task 3:**
- Treat this as a mini-hackathon, focusing on delivering a polished enhancement within a one or two hours.
- whatever you choose to do, choose the scope so that you can finish and make sure to leave the app in a "deployable" state
- scope the work so you can timebox the task - you can use the PR description to list and discuss the things you decided to de-scope, potential next steps etc.

## Practicalities
When you're ready to tackle the challenge, clone the repository (not fork) and create separate pull requests for each task in your version of the repo. Approach each task as if you're collaborating with a team, ensuring clear documentation and adherence to best practices. Merge each pull request upon completion of the respective task.

Once you've completed the challenge, share the link to your repository with us. If privacy is a concern, we can provide email addresses for repository access. Additionally, consider deploying your improved version of the app online (e.g. using Netlify or a similar service) for easy access and evaluation.

We're excited to witness your innovation and expertise in action. Happy coding, and we look forward to your solution!
